## Overview

The DDoS Attack Tool is a powerful and sophisticated Python script developed for security professionals, penetration testers, and network administrators. It provides an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) that enables controlled and comprehensive Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack simulations. This professional-grade tool allows users to assess network resilience, evaluate security measures, and proactively identify vulnerabilities by replicating real-world attack scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: The sleek and user-friendly graphical interface facilitates seamless configuration and control of DDoS attack simulations.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune critical parameters, including target IP, port, socket count, and attack timer, to replicate real-world scenarios and adapt to specific network environments.
- **Dynamic Request Generation**: Intelligent generation of randomized headers and data accurately replicates the complexity and diversity of genuine DDoS attacks.
- **Support for Multiple HTTP Methods**: Simulate various attack vectors using popular HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, enabling in-depth analysis of their impact on targeted systems.
- **Comprehensive Logging and Analysis**: Detailed logging of response status codes provides valuable insights into attack effectiveness, system defenses, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Efficient Socket Management**: Robust error handling and efficient socket management techniques ensure stable performance and reliable execution during prolonged attack simulations.
